Tahereh Mafi’s unique writing style and lyrical prose draw you in and once you meet all the amazing characters in this dystopian world (Juliette! Warner! Kenji!), it’s extremely hard to stop flipping the pages to find out what happens next. We devoured Shatter Me, Unravel Me, and Ignite Me when they all first came out, and with the addition of Restore Me (the first in a new three-book arc)  that came out earlier this year, well, it’s basically the perfect time for a re-read binge."

But the bridges Kenna burned are proving impossible to rebuild. Everyone in her daughter’s life is determined to shut Kenna out, no matter how hard she works to prove herself. The only person who hasn’t closed the door on her completely is Ledger Ward, a local bar owner and one of the few remaining links to Kenna’s daughter. But if anyone were to discover how Ledger is slowly becoming an important part of Kenna’s life, both would risk losing the trust of everyone important to them. "
